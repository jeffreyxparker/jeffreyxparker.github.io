This blog is compilation of subjects that I find interesting. Most of the articles will be about data science but expect to see a few articles about politices, parenting, design, economics, sports, religion and recipes. Friends, family and colleagues are invited to guest author.

Professionally, I am a student at Northwestern's Master of Science in Analytics program, but I am actively seeking employment. You can find my digital resume at [www.jeffreyxparker.com](http://www.jeffreyxparker.com) or my paper copy [here](https://jeffreyxparker.github.io/JeffreyParker_resume.pdf).

Short background on me personally: I am married with one baby boy on the way. I favor the Chicago school of economics and lean conservative-libertarian. I love American and Mexican food, fixing up furniture and houses and snowboarding in all conditions. I try to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ and I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (adherents also known as "Latter-day Saints", "LDS" or "Mormons").
