This blog is compilation of subjects that I find interesting. Most of the articles will be about data science but expect to see a few articles about politices, parenting, design, economics, sports, religion and recipes. Friends, family and colleagues are invited to guest author.

Currently, I am a student at Northwestern's Master of Science in Analytics program, but I am actively seeking employment. I am married with one baby boy on the way. I favor the Chicago school of economics and lean conservative-libertarian. I love American and Mexican food, fixing up furniture and houses and snowboarding in all conditions. I try to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ and I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (adherents also known as "Latter-day Saints", "LDS" or "Mormons").

If you want to get in touch for questions, comments, advice, offers or any other reason, feel free to reach out through the usual channels. Contact links are in the icons at the bottom of every page.
