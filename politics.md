## Top Priorities

### Healthcare
The rising cost of healthcare is a source of frustration for everyone, and for many, it’s a burden that’s impossible to bear. Who among us hasn’t received an unexpected bill from a healthcare provider? When we face a health issue, our primary concern shouldn’t be deciphering the complexities of insurance coverage or provider billing—it should be knowing exactly how much we’ll need to pay out of pocket.  
The current system, dominated by opaque pricing and unpredictable insurance processes, creates more headaches than it cures. If elected, my top priority would be to reduce healthcare costs by making price transparency the norm. There are already some promising policies in place, such as requiring hospitals to post prices for common services and offering "good faith estimates" before providing care. However, my vision is to take these efforts further.  
I would introduce legislation that mandates both healthcare providers and insurers to report what services were rendered and how much was charged to a publicly accessible database. Currently, insurance companies hide behind “contracted rates” with providers, leaving patients on the hook for balance bills when provider charges exceed what insurance covers. Insurers profit from these hidden prices, and patients suffer. Wouldn’t it be easier if you could look up the typical costs and coverage for a service you might need? This is the transparency we deserve. To protect patient confidentiality, only aggregate data would be shared, and prices would only be reported when a sufficient number of data points exist.  
In addition to transparency, I believe our healthcare system should shift its focus from treatment to prevention. Hospitals and healthcare networks should be rewarded for building healthier communities, not just for the number of procedures they perform. My plan would incentivize health networks by linking grant money to community health outcomes. This encourages a proactive approach where hospitals become key stakeholders in the well-being of the communities they serve. For instance, if healthcare providers notice an increase in injuries from a specific trail, they could advocate for safety improvements in collaboration with local authorities.  
Our healthcare system must serve patients, not obscure profits, and we should build a system that promotes health, transparency, and accountability.

### Police System
Our police officers are dedicated to keeping our communities safe, and I deeply respect and support their service. However, in today’s politically divisive climate, they are often unfairly cast as antagonists. While I praise them for their hard work, I, like many, might grumble if I received a speeding ticket. Many of our interactions with police happen in stressful moments, so it’s no surprise that some friction exists. Still, Utah’s police force is exceptional, but there’s always room for improvement. My vision is to elevate our "A" rating to an "A+" by helping officers become even more integral to the community—not just as enforcers, but as trusted neighbors and protectors.  
I propose three simple yet impactful changes:  
- **Community-Centered Appearance**: Police officers should wear uniforms that distinguish them as law enforcement but with a softer, more approachable look—jeans and dress shirts, for instance, rather than the more intimidating, militarized attire. This would help humanize officers and reduce the "us vs. them" perception.
- **Positive Interaction Quotas**: Instead of quotas focused on issuing speeding tickets or fines, officers would be encouraged to meet quotas for positive community interactions. They could attend local events—churches, parades, activities—while wearing appropriate but identifiable attire, and interact with citizens. Officers would also be encouraged to make proactive visits to areas of potential crime or safety hazards, creating a visible and reassuring presence that builds trust.
- **Funding and Incentives for Safety**: Police departments should be funded based on their success in meeting community safety goals, not simply through punitive measures like ticketing. Budgets would be tied to outcomes that genuinely improve the safety and well-being of our neighborhoods, incentivizing officers to focus on prevention and positive community engagement.  
By fostering deeper connections between officers and the communities they serve, we can ensure that our police are seen as trusted, caring figures working in service to us all—not as detached enforcers of the law. Let’s make our sheriffs and deputies the most respected and popular people in town, and create a safer, stronger Utah.

### Housing
Utah’s housing market is expensive, and the numbers speak for themselves. Our state is a desirable place to live, so housing is in high demand. While everyone wants more affordable housing, there's often resistance when it comes to our own neighborhoods. We all want to buy or rent at lower prices, but we don’t want to see the value of our homes decline. So, how do we address this challenge?  
Most zoning laws are managed at the city level, where city councils shape the look and feel of their communities. If elected, I would advocate for walkable, vibrant "15-minute cities" across Utah—communities where people can meet most of their daily needs within a short walk or bike ride. This would include a mix of residential, retail, and recreational spaces, fostering strong, diverse communities.  
I would push for more mixed-use development, allowing for housing, businesses, and amenities to coexist, creating efficient, people-friendly neighborhoods. While I would support large developers in building affordable housing, I would also prioritize small developers who bring creative, diverse projects to the table. By encouraging healthy competition among developers, we can drive down costs and create more options for Utah residents. Let the most efficient and community-focused developers thrive.  
This balanced approach will help create affordable, vibrant neighborhoods without compromising the value of our existing homes.

## Secondary Priorities

### Taxes
Taxes are never popular, and I believe they should be kept to the bare minimum while ensuring Utah remains the #1 fiscally responsible state. Tax preparation should be simple and straightforward—not the complex ordeal that federal taxes often are. This means eliminating unnecessary special options and making the process clear and easy for everyone.  
To maintain fiscal responsibility, I would push for greater transparency in how tax dollars are spent. This includes clear reporting on state expenditures and ensuring a transparent, competitive bid selection process for public projects. Utah’s taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going and how it’s being used.

### Education
With 95% of Utah’s students attending public schools, it’s crucial that we enforce the highest standards in education. While there are many micro-issues in education today, the solution is simple: create an uncontroversial curriculum centered around core subjects like math, science, language, and creative arts. For any topics that may be contentious, parents should have the option to opt their children out. I trust our public school educators—principals, teachers, and staff—to use their experience and expertise to provide a safe and engaging learning environment for all students.  
I also support school choice, whether that’s through homeschooling, charter schools, or other educational options. While I may not always agree with what is taught outside of the public school system, I firmly believe in the freedom of choice for parents to determine the best education path for their children.  
When it comes to higher education, I’m excited by the changes and innovations taking place. Our universities are adapting to the evolving landscape of education, and I fully support these new avenues for learning.

### Energy
To ensure safe and affordable energy for Utah, I support a diversified energy portfolio that includes nuclear, natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, solar, and wind. Utah is rich in energy resources, and we have the potential not only to meet our own needs but to export energy as well.  
I would work to break down barriers for energy production at all levels:  
- **Large-scale**: Encourage the development of new nuclear power plants.
- **Medium-scale**: Support infrastructure such as rail lines to transport oil to refineries, and allow farmers to lease land for wind operations.
- **Small-scale**: Big-box retail stores should be required to install solar panels on their unused rooftop space.
- **Micro-scale**: Homeowners with rooftop solar should be able to seamlessly contribute to the grid through enforced net power metering, ensuring that any excess energy benefits the wider community.  
By promoting energy production at all levels, Utah can become a leader in energy innovation and sustainability.

## Not Prioritized; Worth Addressing

### Abortion
Abortion is an issue that often serves as a lightning rod for division, and it's a fight I do not wish to take center stage in. However, I do believe that the regulation of abortion is a state’s right. While I support state-level decision-making, I would oppose any measures that restrict Utahns from leaving the state to seek abortion services elsewhere. As I see it, abortion is a matter for each state to decide, and we should respect the rights of others to make their own determinations.  
I support medically necessary procedures when a pregnancy is not viable or poses a significant health risk. While these may involve the same drugs used in abortion, I believe they are distinct from elective abortions. Philosophically, I view terminating a life as a grave moral issue, but the question of when life begins is complex. I don’t believe life begins at conception, which is why I find day-after pills acceptable. On the other hand, I strongly oppose terminating a pregnancy just before birth, as it feels morally wrong to me.  
The right answer, in my view, lies somewhere between conception and birth. Medically necessary abortions should be treated as an essential part of healthcare and not stigmatized. Additionally, I support exceptions for cases of rape or incest. However, I believe late-term abortions for non-medical reasons should be prohibited.

### Gun Control
Gun control is another lightning rod issue that is not a priority for me. The U.S. Constitution is clear in the Second Amendment that people have the right to own firearms, and unless the amendment is repealed, I will support it. It’s important to remember that the Constitution includes other amendments that are equally significant but not as frequently discussed.  
I prefer to let the gun control debate play out on the national stage, but if pressed on my personal views, I would say I have mixed feelings about gun ownership. For hunting and sport, owning firearms—especially hunting rifles—makes sense. When it comes to protection, I understand the desire to own a handgun. The idea that a potential intruder might encounter an armed homeowner is a compelling reason for many to keep one for self-defense. It’s worth noting that firearms have prevented countless crimes, though these instances rarely make headlines.  
However, data shows that access to firearms is linked to higher suicide rates, which is part of the reason I personally don’t own a gun. As for military-style weapons like semi-automatic firearms, I struggle to see a justified need for civilian ownership, though I am open to hearing those arguments. Just because there may not be a strong reason to own one, does that mean they should be banned? There are certainly many bad reasons someone might want one, but people intent on harm will find ways to carry out their actions regardless of access to specific types of firearms—and the data supports this.

### Conservative, Liberal, Moderate, Republican, Democrat, Other?
Human. Politicians often use labels like “a champion of conservative values” or “a leader in progressiveness” to win votes and rally support. Don’t be swayed by this shallow rhetoric. Who is the better candidate: a closed-minded figurehead repeating claims that our freedoms are under attack, or an empathetic, open-minded servant committed to evaluating each situation with a clear, rational perspective? The stronger leader focuses on submitting specific, data-driven plans to improve our communities—not on stoking fear.  
Don’t fall for scare tactics; instead, look for leaders with humanistic qualities.

### Gender-Affirming Care for Youth
This is a difficult and complex issue. When it comes to gender-affirming care for consenting adults, I believe personal freedom should prevail—people should be able to make their own choices. Gender-affirming care for infants, however, is morally wrong in my view.  
For youth, the issue falls somewhere in the middle. Both allowing and restricting gender-affirming care will cause pain for different people, at different times. There are consequences whether it’s permitted or banned. Philosophically, I believe it’s best to wait until individuals are consenting adults before undergoing procedures or taking medications. While I understand that this can be painful for youth seeking care earlier, I think such a significant decision is best made with full adult consent.

### Immigration
Immigration is primarily a national issue, but it’s one that impacts Utah as well. I have great respect for people from all nations and support hard-working, morally upright global citizens who come to the United States and Utah seeking to improve their lives. I also stand with refugees and asylum seekers who are in search of stability and prosperity. Our community benefits from the diversity, resilience, and contributions of those who seek a better life here.

### Transgender Girls/Boys in High School Sports
Let common sense and decency prevail—let all youth play. The data shows that this is not a widespread issue, and I believe that all students should have the opportunity to participate in sports.

### Vaccines
Vaccination is a personal choice, and I believe people should have the freedom to decide what’s best for themselves and their families.

### Protecting the Family
I love my family and want to protect them. Philosophically, I believe in the rights of parents to make decisions for their children in most cases. I also believe in the freedom for individuals to choose their spouse and marry whomever they wish, even if it’s a decision or moral that I may personally disagree with. The core of my belief is that families should have the freedom to make their own choices.

### Federal Lands and National Parks
The common interest for most people is to keep our beautiful wilderness clean and accessible. I believe local governance generally does the best job of managing these areas, as they are more in tune with the needs and values of the community. I would advocate against further national land grabs unless the local community supports it. Additionally, I would support increasing state control and establishing localized offices for any federal oversight to ensure that management is more responsive to local needs.

### Caucus vs Primary
Let the parties decide how they want to handle it. I believe they should have the freedom to choose the system that works best for them.

### Social Media Companies
Social media can be both harmful and beneficial—it all depends on how it’s used. Personally, I prefer some platforms over others. I limit my time on social media because I’m aware of the potential negatives. I don’t believe we need to resort to lawsuits to force changes to these platforms. Instead, I think companies should self-regulate and improve their products on their own terms.  
It’s also worth questioning why only social media companies are under such heavy scrutiny. Violent video games, for example, have been shown to negatively impact mental health as well, yet they’re rarely held to the same standard.

### Ranked Choice Voting
I support ranked choice voting and think it’s a fairer way to elect our leaders. However, it’s not a fight I’m looking to lead. What I do take issue with is straight party voting—it oversimplifies our democratic process and encourages people to vote along party lines without considering individual candidates or their merits. We need more thoughtful, engaged voting, not a rubber stamp for any one party.

### Utah Flag
Is this really still an issue? Personally, I like the new flag. It gives Utah a fresh and modern brand, something that better represents who we are today.

### Inland Port
The Inland Port presents a tremendous opportunity for Utah, but it shouldn’t be overshadowed by scandals involving developers or oversight. While it will bring more rail and truck traffic, I view rail as a net benefit, and truck traffic can be managed with thoughtful planning.  
There are environmental concerns, but globally, net emissions will be lower as more efficient logistics are put in place. The port will also lower costs for Utahns by making our transportation system more efficient. We should engage some of the brightest minds to solve the inefficiencies at major ports like LA and demonstrate how logistics can operate smoothly, making our economy stronger and society wealthier.

### Ski Busses and Gondola
Oh, the shenanigans! What exactly is UTA up to? As a passionate skier who loves Utah’s resorts, I believe the resorts themselves need to take responsibility for their parking problems instead of relying on public infrastructure to fix them. Before adding new lifts, they should prioritize building parking garages.  
As for the traffic issues in Little Cottonwood Canyon, I’m highly skeptical that a gondola is the best solution. However, I trust local leaders to make the right decision for the community, and I will support their efforts to find the best way forward.

### Infrastructure
I used to dislike UDOT, but after living in Chicago and dealing with IDOT, I came to appreciate UDOT’s work. When it comes to infrastructure, I believe we should rely on smart designers, city planners, engineers, architects, developers, and others to help us create vibrant, resilient communities. This often means prioritizing walkability and ensuring easy, efficient transit options—whether that’s roads, rail, or buses.
